## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game with simple rules and a straightforward objective. Here’s a detailed description:

## Objective

The goal of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row on a 3x3 grid. The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

## Setup

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Two players choose their marks, traditionally 'X' and 'O'.
One player is chosen to go first, and play alternates between the two players.
Gameplay
Starting the Game: The first player places their mark (X or O) in any one of the nine available squares.
Turns: Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.
Winning the Game: The game is won by the first player to place three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw: If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
Strategies
Center First: Starting in the center gives a player the most opportunities to create a line of three.
Corners: Playing in the corners can be a strategic move to create multiple opportunities for a win.
Blocking: Preventing your opponent from getting three in a row by placing your mark in the line they are trying to complete.
Example Game
Here’s an example of a game:

```markdown
X | O | X
O | X |  
 | | O
```

In this example, the player with 'X' wins by completing a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right.

## Variations

Larger Grids: The game can be played on larger grids like 4x4 or 5x5, where the objective might be to get four or five in a row, respectively.
Different Rules: Some variations may include different starting rules or additional ways to win.
Tic Tac Toe is a simple game but offers depth in strategy and tactics, making it a popular and timeless choice for players of all ages.
